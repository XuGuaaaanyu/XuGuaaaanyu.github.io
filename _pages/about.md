I'm an undergraduate student pursuing dual degrees in Computer Engineering at the [University of Michigan](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/academics/undergraduate/majors-minors/computer-engineering-major/) and Mechanical Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). Currently, I work as a research assistant at [Hybrid Dynamic Robotics Lab](https://soft.robotics.umich.edu/) directed by Prof. [Xiaonan (Sean) Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MNKU_WcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My research interests center on robotics, wearable devices, and intelligent sensing, with particular focus on haptics interface and tactile sensing for robotics. I enjoy bridging hardware and software through system-level design, from custom electronics and control to machine learning for perception and interaction.
