This project was built for **ME3500J Design and Manufacturing (II)** as a term-long class project where each team designed and manufactured an **autonomous vehicle** to traverse a pre-defined track with multiple terrains—flat ground, a 60 mm step into a 120 mm-high sandbox (and back out via a slope), a pair of 90 mm height-restriction bars, a printed turning sign to recognize, and a final parking box.

# Design of Wheel Transformation Mechanism
The design of the transformable wheel is a reinvention of my previous [patent](http://epub.cnipa.gov.cn/cred/CN221698395U), where we adopt the wheel expansion mechanism, but made some changes to eliminate the extra servo for it to better fit into a car. The major innovation in this project is a single-motor, dual-clutch transmission that drives both locomotion and transformation. Two electromagnetic clutches are used to release or lock the relative rotation of the wheel hub and the gear to enable wheel expansion and shrink. The picture below shows how the thing works.
