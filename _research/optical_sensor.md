Accurately reconstructing the global deformation of a thin, film-like structure is essential for a wide range of perception and manipulation tasks in robotic systems. However, conventional methods usually suffer from complex wiring, electromagnetic interference, and limited compliance with large-scale deformation. In this work, we develop a highly deformable optical waveguide sensor that reconstructs out-of-plane surface geometry from light-intensity measurements by internal photodiodes (PDs). The sensor is equipped with edge-mount LEDs and sparsely distributed PDs interconnected via liquid metal. Sufficient independent optical measurements are acquired by implementing a high-speed LED scanning scheme. An efficient data-driven model is developed to reconstruct the sensor's 3D deformation in real time accurately. The model is trained and evaluated on a real-world dataset that reconstructs surface geometry as a point cloud solely based on optical measurements obtained by the PDs. The evaluation suggests we can achieve an average reconstruction error in terms of chamfer distance of 1.307 mm at a frame rate of about 90 Hz. These results suggest a practical route toward scalable, robust proprioceptive shape sensing for soft robots and other deformable structures.
